### Overview

Contributions from the community are very welcome, including but not limited to new endpoints, new/better documentation and refactoring.

Forking the repo and submitting pull requests is just fine.

There is no specific roadmap and so far features have been added when the community needed them.

We have tried to have all the versions be backward compatible so far. If we're going to have breaking changes, we can revisit when we have a pull request.
